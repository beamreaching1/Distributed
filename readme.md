This repository is a collection of some distributed computing projects I completed during my graduate studies.

All three folders contain implementations using the MPI standard.

estPi estimates pi given a number of RNG samples specified by the user. The more samples the more accurate the estimated value of pi becomes. 

heat produces a color map of a simple heat simulation. Most of the values are hard coded but are easy to change.

sort is a simple python program that sorts a list using the bucket sort algorithm. It is distributed in nature and is a good example of parallel sorting.
